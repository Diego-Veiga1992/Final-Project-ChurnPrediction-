# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to **analyze, visualize, and model customer cancellation behavior (churn)**, focusing on identifying patterns and predicting which customers are most likely to leave the company.

---

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**

### Libraries:
- `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation and analysis  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
- `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn` – modeling and evaluation  
- `CatBoost`, `LightGBM` – advanced machine learning algorithms

---

## 🔍 Project Stages

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value handling  
- Data type corrections  
- Distribution analysis  

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Created binary column for churn flag  
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical features  
- Extracted year, month, and day from subscription start date  
- Applied resampling to balance target classes  

### 3. Data Visualization
- Time-based plots revealed churn consistency across months  

**Key insights:**
- Many customers cancel within 2 months (early retention issue)  
- Average churn time is around 1.5 years  
- Monthly plans have higher churn concentration  

### 4. Predictive Modeling

Evaluation of several models:

| Model                | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC AUC | Score (/10) |
|----------------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| LightGBM             | 0.82     | 0.73     | 0.91    | ⭐ 10.0       |
| CatBoost             | 0.80     | 0.73     | 0.90    | ⭐ 10.0       |
| Gradient Boosting    | 0.78     | 0.69     | 0.89    | ⭐ 9.2        |
| Random Forest        | 0.78     | 0.68     | 0.87    | ⭐ 8.3        |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.74     | 0.42     | 0.58    | ❌ 0.0        |
| Decision Tree        | 0.75     | 0.65     | 0.85    | ⭐ 7.5        |

> **Top performing models:** LightGBM and CatBoost

## ✅ Conclusion

The complete pipeline provides a **strong and accurate foundation** for churn prediction.

The company can now:
- Anticipate cancellations and act proactively  
- Focus on early retention (especially within the first 2 months)  
- Reevaluate monthly plans, which show the highest churn rates
